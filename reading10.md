# IMAGES

The src attribute is required, and contains the path to the image you want to embed. The alt attribute holds a text description of the image, which isn't mandatory but is incredibly useful for accessibility — screen readers read this description out to their users so they know what the image means. Alt text is also displayed on the page if the image can't be loaded for some reason: for example, network errors, content blocking, or linkrot.

* There are many other attributes to achieve various purposes:

Referrer/CORS control for security and privacy: see crossorigin and referrerpolicy. Use both width and height to set the intrinsic size of the image, allowing it to take up space before it loads, to mitigate content layout shifts. Responsive image hints with sizes and srcset (see also the picture element and our Responsive images tutorial).

## Supported image formats

The HTML standard doesn't list what image formats to support, so each user agent supports different formats. A complete guide to image formats supported by web browsers is available. Below is a list of the image formats that are most commonly used on the web, as well as some older formats that should no longer be used, despite existing content possibly still using them

## SEO

SEO value Title tags used to be of huge importance to search engines. A title tag is one of the first things that people see in SERPs. Thus, these tags used to be the ones that got stuffed with keywords up to madness.

Today search engines still understand what a page is about from a title tag. However, with Google's shift to semantic search, the value of a title tag has got somewhat lower. For example, the researchers from Backlinko found that a keyword-optimized title tag was associated with a better ranking, but the correlation was smaller than it once was.

Now the search engine is able to interpret a page's topic without exact keywords in the title but on the basis of all the elements of a page: meta description, images, users' activity metrics, and of course, content itself.
